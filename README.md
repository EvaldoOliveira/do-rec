do-rec
Description:

This script automates audio recording using the `arecord` utility, providing options for scheduling, file splitting, and custom output paths. Logs session details and supports email notifications for session progress and errors.

Assumptions:

Save do-rec.ini in your home directory and the sheel as you wish ( I prefer to use /usr/local/bin)
